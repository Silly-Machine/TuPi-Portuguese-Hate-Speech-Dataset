# Portuguese Hate Speech Dataset (TuPI)


The Portuguese Hate Speech Dataset (TuPI) is a project that aims to develop models for identifying hate speech. It is formed by combining datasets annotated by Fortuna *et. al.*, Milk *et. al.*, Vargas *et. al.* in addition to 10 thousand unpublished annotated documents.

This repository is organized as follows:

```bash
